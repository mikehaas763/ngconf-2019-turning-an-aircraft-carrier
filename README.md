# CapitalOne ngconf-app

## Build

Build the application, and the two deployable units: team-a and team-b, and copy all the shared UMD assets over to the dist directory:

```sh
npm run build
```

## Serve

Once the application has been built as per the above instructions, run:

```sh
npm start
```

This will launch an HTTP server for the root level index.html
